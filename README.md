# Project â€“ Lexical Analysis and Code Interpretation

Author: Brennan Chan  
Initial Codebase: Rida Bazzi  
Course: CSE 340 â€“ Principles of Programming Languages

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository contains three sequential projects completed for CSE 340, The Principles of Programming Languages.

Together, they form a series of sequential and more advanced projects that pertain to the analysis of a basic programming language, progressing through lexical analysis, grammar analysis, and intermediate code generation with interpretation.

## ðŸ“¦ Project 1 â€“ Lexical Analyzer

**Description:**  
Implements a lexical analyzer (lexer) in C++ that reads source code and breaks it into tokens such as identifiers, keywords, operators, numbers, and delimiters.

**Key Features:**
- Supports keywords, identifiers, base-08/16 integers, real numbers
- Token lookahead with `UngetToken()`
- Skips whitespace and detects invalid tokens

**Run Instructions:**
```bash
g++ lexer.cc inputbuf.cc -o lexer
./lexer < input.txt
```
Token Types:
- Keywords: TYPE, VAR, REAL, INT, ...
- Operators: +, -, /, *, =, <>, ...
- Delimiters: ,, :, {, }, ...
- Special: ERROR, END_OF_FILE

## ðŸ“¦ Project 2 â€“ Grammar Analyzer

**Description:**  
Parses a context-free grammar from input and performs one of five tasks: listing grammar symbols, removing useless symbols, or computing FIRST and FOLLOW sets.

**Tasks Supported:**
*Each of these tasks has test case files associated with each of these tested tasks. These can be denoted by the test file name, then "expected", then the expected test case result for that particular task.*
- Print grammar symbols (terminals and non-terminals) - denoted with the file suffix "expected1"
- Eliminate useless symbols - denoted with the file suffix "expected2"
- Compute FIRST sets - denoted with the file suffix "expected3"
- Compute FOLLOW sets - denoted with the file suffix "expected4"
- Check if grammar supports predictive parsing - denoted with the file suffix "expected5"

**Run Instructions:**
```bash
g++ project2.cc lexer.cc inputbuf.cc -o grammar_analyzer
./grammar_analyzer [TASK_NUMBER] < grammar_input.txt
```
Token Types:
- ID â€“ Alphanumeric identifiers
- ARROW â€“ ->
- STAR â€“ *
- HASH â€“ #
- END_OF_FILE, ERROR

## ðŸ“¦ Project 3 â€“ Intermediate Code Generator & Interpreter

**Description:**  
Implements a compiler for a simple C-like language that parses input code, builds a linked list-based intermediate representation (IR), and simulates execution using a provided interpreter.

**Key Features:**
- Parses constructs like `assign`, `if`, `while`, `switch`, `for`, `input`, and `output`
- Builds an IR graph using `InstructionNode` structures
- Supports jump logic with conditional and unconditional branches (`CJMP`, `JMP`)
- Uses a memory model and variable-location mapping (`mem[]` and location table)
- Execution is performed by traversing and interpreting the generated instruction graph

**Run Instructions:**
```bash
g++ compiler.cc demo.cc lexer.cc inputbuf.cc -o a.out
./a.out < tests/input.txt
```
Token Types:
- Keywords: TYPE, VAR, REAL, INT, ...
- Operators: +, -, /, *, =, <>, ...
- Delimiters: ,, :, {, }, ...
- Special: ERROR, END_OF_FILE

**Execution Model:**
- Variables declared in the var section are assigned memory locations using a location table
- Input values are consumed sequentially from the inputs section
- The compiler builds a linked list of instructions representing the input program
- The interpreter walks through this instruction list, simulating control flow and memory updates

**Supported Statements:**
- `assign` â€“ assignment of variables or expressions  
- `input` / `output` â€“ read input values or print variable contents  
- `if` â€“ conditional execution using `CJMP` and `NOOP`  
- `while` â€“ loops implemented with `CJMP`, `JMP`, and `NOOP`  
- `for` â€“ translated into `assign`, `CJMP`, `JMP` sequences like C-style for-loops  
- `switch` â€“ implemented via a sequence of `CJMP` and conditional blocks
